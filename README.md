# TheMorningAfter
An homage to the era of Jet Set Willy.

This game was originally produced during September 2018.  

The initial prototype can be experienced here: https://oclipa.github.io/Games/TheMorningAfter/

Work began again at the beginning of December 2018, with the initial Beta release available at the beginning of February 2019.

The final, commercial version was released ######## and can be experienced here: ################


I estimate that the final project took around 300 developer-hours (very roughly equating to the order of $10,000).  

In addition, it required around 30 tester-hours (of the order of $1,000).
