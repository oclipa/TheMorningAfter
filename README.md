# TheMorningAfter
An homage to the era of Jet Set Willy.

The prototype for this game was originally produced during September 2018.  

Work began again at the beginning of December 2018, with the initial Beta release available at the beginning of February 2019.

The final, commercial version was released March 2019 and can be experienced here: https://oclipa.itch.io/the-morning-after


I estimate that the final project took around 300 developer-hours.


* V1.00 - 2019/03/06 - Initial Release
* V1.01 - 2019/04/24 - Added map and refined some sprites
